# RoadNetwork
üõ£Ô∏è Road Network Analyzer ‚Äì KIT205 Assignment 1
This project is a C-based prototype that simulates a database-style application for storing and analyzing large-scale road networks between cities. It was developed as part of KIT205 Data Structures and Algorithms at the University of Tasmania.

The system represents road connections using two data structure implementations:

Adjacency List (linked list of roads)

Adjacency Matrix (2D array of edge weights)

It includes classic pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford, with features for:

Loading and visualizing road maps from a file

Measuring performance of different graph implementations

Comparing shortest path algorithms

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is one of my first projects using advanced data structures and performance testing. There are likely many mistakes, simplifications, and areas for improvement. It was developed primarily as a learning exercise, and feedback is welcome!
